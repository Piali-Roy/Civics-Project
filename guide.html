		<h1>How to reduce food waste</h1>
		
		<ol>
		
		<li><h2>Buy locally</h2>
			Buying locally will help support businesses near you and create more employment opportunities. Local produce also has less of a carbon footprint
			then foods from overseas as it does not need to be transported through overseas plane, long truck trips or more.

			<li><h2>Buy misfit produce</h2>
			A lot of produce at grocery stores is not sold because they are ugly, this causes a lot of food waste. One thing you can do to combat
			this is buy the ugly looking produce, usually, stores will also sell misfit produce for cheaper and there are online food subscriptions that
			will send you rejected produce.

			<li><h2>Understand expiration dates</h2>
			Understanding expiration dates will allow you to use up foods before they need to be thrown away, leaving less food wasted
			, some times the <a href = "https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/food-labeling/food-product-dating/food-product-dating">expiration dates</a> are only recommended, and sometimes they are just put to help stores keep inventory of their products.
			
			<table>
					<tr>
						<th>Type of food date label</th>
						<th>Description</th>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>Best if used by/before</td>
						<td>Displays the date in which the product has the best flavour, not a saftey date</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>Sell-by</td>
						<td>Displays how long a store should display a product for, is meant more for inventory managment, and is not a 
						saftey date</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>Use-by</td>
						<td>The last date by which the product is at top quality, not a saftey date except when used for infants.</td>
					</tr>

			<li><h2>Store food correctly</h2>
			<a href = "https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/are-you-storing-food-safely">Storing food </a>correctly can increase the nutritional value of foods, decrease the chances of cross contamination and can
			prolong the shelf life of foods which will help prevent them from spoiling and unnecessarily being thrown away. For example
			bananas ripen other foods faster as it produced more ethylene gasses, to prolong food storage keep bananas away from others
			fruits and vegetables.

			<li><h2>Food planning</h2>
			Food planning could be a useful way to not only balance your diet and make sure you are getting enough
			of a variety of foods. It is also a very good way to reduce your food waste, by keeping track of what you
			eat and do not you can plan meals based on your preferences, that way you will end up with meals you actually
			eat and less food waste, this will be better for the environment and your wallet.

			<li><h2>Cook only what you need</h2>
			Cook only what you think you will eat at a time, it will reduce the amount of left overs you have and encourage you to waste fewer foods. Sometimes
			people overestimate the amount of food they eat so cooking only what is necessary will reduce portion sizes and be better for your wallet.

			</li>
			
			<li><h2>Dont immediatly throw away food scraps</h2>
			Often times there are many purposes that peels, stems, tops or any other food scraps have, they often can be eaten and if not 
			eaten they can be boiled with water and some seasoning to make vegetable stock. You can start your own <a href = "https://www.ruralsprout.com/regrow-vegetables/">mini 
			garden</a> as some plant parts can be used as seed.

			<li><h2>Use your leftovers</h2>
			A lot of people already have leftovers but a lot of people also forget to use them, they remain in the back of the refrigerator until
			someone finds them rotting away and dumps them. You should put your leftovers into glass containers so it's visible and you are more 
			likely to remember to use them.
			<img src = "Images/leftover.jpg" alt = "leftovers"></li>
			
			<li><h2>Share with others</h2>
			Sharing is a very good way to use up foods, when you accidentally make to much of something, share it with someone else and avoid wasting it. There
			are a lot of <a href = "https://familyapp.com/try-a-food-sharing-app/">sites and apps</a> online based sharing and getting foods from others.
